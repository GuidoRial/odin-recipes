# odin-recipes
Did this on the 15th of september 2021, it's the first thing I wrote in HTML after a few days of reading the theory. 
I'll probably come back here, by now I know a little bit of CSS so I probably could do something nicer, but this project it's not a priority right now (as I just started learning JavaScript).
