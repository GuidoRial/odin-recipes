    <h2>The definitive sweet, the allmighty Dulce de Leche</h2>
    <p>Don't let the uruguayan fool you, it's argentinian. Although it's common everywhere in latinamerica. It's also the alfajores' best friend. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1L of milk</li>
            <li>350g of sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 spoon of sodium bicarbonate</li>
            <li>vanilla essence</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>How to make it</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat everything in a cooking pot to medium heat and stir constantly</li>
            <li>Once the sugar disolves itself, put the fire to low heat and stir for 2 hours. Don't let it boil</li>
            <li>Once you get the consistency shown in the picture above, turn off the heat and (you guessed it) keep sterring for 10 minutes until it cools off</li>
            <li>Put it in a jar, store it in the fridge</li>
        </ol>
